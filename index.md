# SFB Rules
1. Using Colored Tools is not allowed. To prevent destruction in SFB, we mostly disable the usage of Colored Tools. If you find it enabled, please report it to any owner or admin there immediately. *Note : We may enable the usage of Colored Tools for special purposes, e.g. Clearing a mess caused by mass griefing*
2. Griefing in SFB is strictly prohibited. We want SFB to be a safe building
