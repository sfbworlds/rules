# SFB Rules
1. Using Colored Tools is not allowed. To prevent destruction in SFB, we mostly disable the usage of Colored Tools. If you find it enabled, please report it to any owner or admin there immediately. If you are caught using Colored Tools, you will be kicked and banned if repeated. *Note : We may enable the usage of Colored Tools for special purposes, e.g. Clearing a mess caused by mass griefing*
2. Griefing in SFB is strictly prohibited, as we want SFB to be a safe building atmosphere. If you are caught griefing, whether by members or camera footage, you will be immediately and permanently banned.
3. Do not block the camera. It is **REALLY REALLY REALLY** important that we have camera footage, as if a griefing happens, we will know who griefed it. If you do block the camera, it will result in a respawn, kick and ban respectively.
4. Blueprints are limited to the owner only. To prevent blueprint spam, every blueprint being placed will need to be sent as a link in the chat box, so the owner can place it.
5. Do not spam the chat. The chat is a way to communicate between players. If you spam the chat, you are blocking SFB's communication, and will result in an immediate ban.
6. Do not steal things from chests. The chests are a vault to keep SFB Foods (e.g. Label Label Juice) safe and secure for trading at the upper floor. If you are caught stealing, you will be made a visitor immediately. Admins can take a maximum amount of one hundred things from the chests on the upper floor, and a maximum of twenty things from the chests from the lower floor. Shop owners can do anything with the things in their chests, but not others'. Violating this rule will result in you being made a visitor.
7. Communicate in English. Only communicate in English, but be considerate of other languages. If you communicate in other languages, it will not be considered in the camera footage.
8. Bullying, racism, sexism and anti-LGBTQ+ is strictly prohibited, and will result in a ban if found doing so.
9. Do not build or chat about NSFW content. If you are found doing so, you will be banned immediately.
10. Have Fun!
